# Surps_up
## Purpose:
### We are looking for weather patterns in Hawaii to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop. We choose, the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
#### Resourses:
### Software:  Python, Visual Studio Code 
### Data Tools: SQLAlchemy, Anaconda prompt, Jupyter Notebook
## Result:Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, shows a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation. The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also similar.

## Summary:
### The weather in December and June are very similar, additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather.

### We need the weather station closest to our prospective location,we can see the more station by using Flask (app.py), which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.

### Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation means are close. The data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.
